# TODOS 
- Integrate with Firebase
- Update datastore on logout
- Only allow one logged in instance per user
- Add delete list functionality
- Add Login screen
- Reset card timeLeft to last manually set time when moved to doneList 
- Add doneList button that returns all cards in doneList to the list they were last in
- Add transition for cards disappearing and appearing when programmatically moved
- Highlight inputs when hovered, highlight card background elevation when hovered
- Style cards better
- Cleanup console logs and unused stuff
- (Scrapped) ~~Get card height and margin programmatically, for mobile since it moving to donelist uses hardcoded height~~

# Known Bugs
- The first click on a lists title clears the title
- Clicking on a Card's title and menu icon does not pause the timer 
- Clicking on a Card's clock icon twice does not resume the timer
